# Project2
Noughts-&-Crosses

Project Goals and Challenges
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly version of Noughts and Crosses that runs smoothly in a web browser. To achieve this, the following challenges and requirements are addressed:

Game Logic Development: I will implement the core logic to handle player turns, check for a win or draw, and manage the game state effectively.
Dynamic UI Updates: I aim to ensure that the game board updates in real-time based on player actions, providing immediate feedback on moves and game status.
Responsive Design: The project focuses on creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface that adapts to different screen sizes.
Event Handling and User Interaction: I will manage user interactions through click events, allow players to reset the game, and display dynamic messages to enhance the user experience.
Code Structure and Readability: The code is written in a clean, modular, and maintainable way using TypeScript to ensure it is easy to understand and can be enhanced in the future.
This project aims to provide both a fun game for users to play and a technical exercise in web development, using modern tools and practices to build an interactive browser-based application.
